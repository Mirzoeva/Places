# Places

An iOS app built with SwiftUI that demonstrates deep linking into a modified Wikipedia app.

This app displays a list of places loaded from a remote JSON, and allows users to add their own custom places. Upon selecting a place, the app opens Wikipedia directly at that location using a custom URL scheme.
